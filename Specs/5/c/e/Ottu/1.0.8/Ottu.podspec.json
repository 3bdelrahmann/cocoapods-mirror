  "description": "## Features\n\n**Simplified security**: We make it simple for you to collect sensitive data such as credit card numbers and remain [PCI compliant](). This means the sensitive data is sent directly to Stripe instead of passing through your server.\n\n**Apple Pay**: We provide a [seamless integration with Apple Pay]().\n\n**SCA-ready**: The SDK automatically performs native [3D Secure authentication]() if needed to comply with [Strong Customer Authentication]() regulation in Europe.\n\n**Native UI**: We provide native screens and elements to collect payment details. For example, [PaymentSheet]() is a prebuilt UI that combines all the steps required to pay - collecting payment details, billing details, and confirming the payment - into a single sheet that displays on top of your app.",
